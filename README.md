## Projects
### [Mushroom_Classification](https://github.com/VincenzoPresta/Mushroom_Classification)
**Description:** 
A data mining project focused on classifying mushrooms as either edible or poisonous using machine learning techniques. The project utilizes the "Mushrooms Classification" dataset to explore various aspects of data preprocessing, feature selection, and model training.   The goal is to develop a reliable classification model that can predict the edibility of mushrooms based on their features.
**Technologies Used:** 
Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Keras, Matplotlib
**Development Environment:**
Jupyter Notebook
